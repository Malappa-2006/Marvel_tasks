# TASK:1 3D PRINTING.  

**Objective** : Understand the working of a 3D printer, check out the online resources. Understand what's an STL file, and then learn to slice it. Go through the SOP'S regarding the 3d printer. Learn about bed temperature, infill density and other printer settings. Finally get an STL file from the internet, and slice it and put it for print.

**Learnings and Outcomes**: I learned how a 3D printer works. It uses PLA, a plastic filament, and melts it to build objects layer by layer. I understood what an STL(Standard Tessellation Language.) file is â€“ it is a 3D model file that tells the printer what shape to make. Then I learned to slice the STL file using software like Ultimaker Cura. Slicing converts the model into G-code, which gives step-by-step instructions to the printer. I explored settings like bed temperature, infill density, and layer height. Due to a fault in the 3D printer, I could not print, but I clearly understood the process.   

# TASK 2: API
**Objective:** Learn what an API is and how it works. Using any API of your choice, build a user interface (web app, mobile app, etc.) to make calls and display information.  
**Learnings and Outcomes:** I learned that API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for two programs to talk to each other. It sends a request and gets a response (usually in JSON format). I also learned to make API calls using code and display the data in a simple user interface. I successfully connected to a sample API, got live data, and displayed it on a simple web page. I understood how requests, responses, and endpoints work, and gained hands-on experience in building small projects using APIs.

 # Report on L293D Motor Driver IC
  ## What is L293D?
The L293D is a popular motor driver IC used to control the direction and speed of DC motors. It features an H-bridge configuration, allowing for bidirectional control of two motors independently. This IC is widely used in robotics and automation projects due to its ability to interface with low-power microcontrollers and drive high-current motors.
---

![Alt text](https://github.com/Malappa-2006/Marvel_tasks/blob/main/datasheet/L293D.jpg?raw=true)  
---

**Specifications**  

- Operating Voltage        : 4.5V to 36V
- Peak Output Current      : 1.2A per channel
- Continuous Output Current: 600mA per channel
- Logic Input Voltage      : 5V (TTL compatible)
- Enable Pins              : Allow for PWM control of motor speed  
---

## How Does It Work?
The L293D has two H-bridges inside. An H-bridge is a circuit that controls which way the motor spins by changing the direction of the current. We can use it to make the motor move forward, backward, or stop.  
---


## What is an H-Bridge?
An H-bridge is a simple circuit that allows a motor to be driven forward or backward. It consists of four switches (transistors or MOSFETs) that can be controlled to create different voltage polarities across the motor terminals.
It has four switches (transistors).
By turning the switches on and off in the right way, you can change the flow of electricity to the motor.
This controls the motor's direction.  
---


## Controlling Speed: PWM
PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation. It's a way to control how much power the motor gets.
PWM is a technique used to control the speed of a motor by varying the duty cycle of a digital signal. By adjusting the duty cycle, the average voltage and current delivered to the motor can be controlled, thus regulating its speed. By turning the power on and off really quickly:  
---


- If it's on more than off, the motor goes faster.
- If it's off more than on, the motor slows down.
- We can send these PWM signals to the L293D from a microcontroller, like Arduino, to control the motor's speed.
--- 
## Conclusion:
The L293D motor driver is a robust and versatile IC that simplifies the control of DC motors.
Its H-bridge configuration and PWM capability allow for precise control of motor direction and speed, making it an essential component in many electronic and robotic projects.

# TASK 15: INTRODUCTION TO VR  

**Objective:** Familiarize yourself with what Virtual Reality is. Make a detailed study about what's the difference between VR and AR. Mention about the trends in the space and technology stack being developed.  

**Outcomes and Learnings:**
I experienced the VR for the first time in the MARVEL Lab. It was an incredible experience. 

## Here is the information about the VR and AR: 
---

**Virtual Reality (VR)** is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appears to be real. It makes the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings. We can interact with these surroundings using special controllers.
---


**Augmented Reality (AR)** is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time. The key difference between AR and VR is that the VR lets us enter a whole new world and lets us experience it whereas the AR makes us experience the digital information into a user's environment.
---

## Trends in Space Tech:
- Space Exploration 
- Mission Planning
- Space Safety Training
- Space Tourism
