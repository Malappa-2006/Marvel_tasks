# TASK:1 3D PRINTING.  

**Objective** : Understand the working of a 3D printer, check out the online resources. Understand what's an STL file, and then learn to slice it. Go through the SOP'S regarding the 3d printer. Learn about bed temperature, infill density and other printer settings. Finally get an STL file from the internet, and slice it and put it for print.

**Learnings and Outcomes**: I learned how a 3D printer works. It uses PLA, a plastic filament, and melts it to build objects layer by layer. I understood what an STL(Standard Tessellation Language.) file is â€“ it is a 3D model file that tells the printer what shape to make. Then I learned to slice the STL file using software like Ultimaker Cura. Slicing converts the model into G-code, which gives step-by-step instructions to the printer. I explored settings like bed temperature, infill density, and layer height. Due to a fault in the 3D printer, I could not print, but I clearly understood the process.   

# TASK 2: API
**Objective:** Learn what an API is and how it works. Using any API of your choice, build a user interface (web app, mobile app, etc.) to make calls and display information.  
**Learnings and Outcomes:** I learned that API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for two programs to talk to each other. It sends a request and gets a response (usually in JSON format). I also learned to make API calls using code and display the data in a simple user interface. I successfully connected to a sample API, got live data, and displayed it on a simple web page. I understood how requests, responses, and endpoints work, and gained hands-on experience in building small projects using APIs.
