# TASK:1 3D PRINTING.  

**Objective** : Understand the working of a 3D printer, check out the online resources. Understand what's an STL file, and then learn to slice it. Go through the SOP'S regarding the 3d printer. Learn about bed temperature, infill density and other printer settings. Finally get an STL file from the internet, and slice it and put it for print.

**Learnings and Outcomes**: I learned how a 3D printer works. It uses PLA, a plastic filament, and melts it to build objects layer by layer. I understood what an STL(Standard Tessellation Language.) file is â€“ it is a 3D model file that tells the printer what shape to make. Then I learned to slice the STL file using software like Ultimaker Cura. Slicing converts the model into G-code, which gives step-by-step instructions to the printer. I explored settings like bed temperature, infill density, and layer height. Due to a fault in the 3D printer, I could not print, but I clearly understood the process.   

# TASK 2: API
**Objective:** Learn what an API is and how it works. Using any API of your choice, build a user interface (web app, mobile app, etc.) to make calls and display information.  
**Learnings and Outcomes:** I learned that API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for two programs to talk to each other. It sends a request and gets a response (usually in JSON format). I also learned to make API calls using code and display the data in a simple user interface. I successfully connected to a sample API, got live data, and displayed it on a simple web page. I understood how requests, responses, and endpoints work, and gained hands-on experience in building small projects using APIs.

# TASK 3:  WORKING WITH GITHUB  
**Objective:** Familiarize yourself with GitHub integrated workflows (GitHub actions), Issues, and pull requests with this task.


**Outcomes and Learnings:**  

- I learned how to create & delete my own repositories.  
- I learned how to make changes in other's repositories.  
- I forked the given repository into my repository and then cloned the repository.  
- Then, I committed the change which was to remove the +1 from the code.  
- Finally, I issued the pull request.

  # TASK 3: COMMAND LINE ON UBUNTU  
  
**Objective:** Get familiar with Command lines on Ubuntu and do the subtasks as given on MARVEL website.  
**Learnings and Outcomes:** I learned the use of the below commands in Ubuntu:

1. Create a folder named test : mkdir test
2. To change directory         : cd test
3. Create a blank file         : touch blank.txt
4. List files in the terminal  : ls
5. Create 2600 folders         : mkdir M{0001..2600}
6. Concatenate and display two text files: cat text1.txt text2.txt

 # TASK 5: CREATE A PORTFOLIO WEBPAGE  
 **Objective:** Create a website to showcase your portfolio - about yourself, interests, projects, social media profiles and more. It has to be responsive and also pushed to the git repository. CSS can be of your choice and any framework can be used.  
 **Outcomes & Learnings:** I have learnt basic CSS and HTML to create a Portfolio website to show information about myself. I hosted my website on Github to make it accessible to all.
