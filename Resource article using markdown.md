# 🌊 Miller's Planet – The Water World from Interstellar

## 🔍 Objective
To explore the science and mystery behind Miller's Planet as shown in the movie *Interstellar*.

## 🪐 What is Miller's Planet?
Miller's Planet is a fictional water-covered world orbiting near a **supermassive black hole** called **Gargantua**.  
Because it is so close to the black hole, the planet experiences **extreme time dilation** – **1 hour on the planet = 7 years on Earth**.  
This is due to the intense gravity of Gargantua, which slows down time according to **Einstein’s Theory of Relativity**.

## 🌊 Features of Miller's Planet
- Entire surface is covered with shallow water.  
- Gigantic tidal waves appear because of the black hole’s gravity.  
- The planet receives light from Gargantua, making the environment bright but dangerous.  

## 🛠 Scientific Importance
Miller's Planet shows how **relativity affects time**. The concept helps students understand **gravitational time dilation**, a real physics phenomenon.

## 🎯 Conclusion
Miller's Planet may be fictional, but it represents real science. It teaches us how gravity can bend time and how living near a black hole would completely change our perception of time.
